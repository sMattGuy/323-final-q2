//Q2 in java
/* Given two files that contain sorted integers in ascending order) the task is to merge the two files
into one file that the third file has all the data in the two files and it is also sorted
in ascending order.
Q2: Specs
II. Inputs: a)file 1 a text file contains a list of sorted integers
                        b)file 2(args[1]): the same
II: output:
        A- file 3(args[3]):
            b)debugFile(args[3])
IV. Data Structure
you CANT use any data structure such as array or linked list except those local variables used in main 

V. Main 
Step 0: Open all the files args[3]
Step 1: data1 <- read from file 1// read one input at a time
                data2 <-read from file2
                debugFile <- output data1 and data2 with proper captions ie data 1 = ...
Step 2: if(data <=data2)
                file 3 <- data1 //Write data1 to file3 
                data1 <- read from file 1
                else
                file3 <- data2
                data2 <- read from file2 
    Step 3: repeat step2 while file1 is not empty and file2 is not empty
    Step4: if file1 is empty and file2 is not empty file <- data2
    Step 5: if file2 is empty and file1 is not empty file3 <- data2
    Step 6: if file1 is not empty file3 <- read and output the remaining data from file1 to file 3
    Step 7: if file2 is not empty file3 <-read and output the remaining data from file2 to file3
    Step8: close all files*/
